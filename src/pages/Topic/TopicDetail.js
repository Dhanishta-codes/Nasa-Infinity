              The OCI instrument is used to measure ocean color and assess phytoplankton productivity,
              water quality, and various parameters crucial for understanding ocean ecosystems. It helps
              in monitoring the health of the oceans and provides critical data to study the impact of

              of biological and chemical ocean properties, such as phytoplankton biomass and the composition of 
              phytoplankton communities. These changes in the oceanâ€™s color help identify harmful algal blooms.

              HARP2 (Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter #2) is a wide angle imaging polarimeter designed to measure 
              aerosol particles and clouds, as well as properties of land and water surfaces. The amount and type 
              of particles in suspension in the atmosphere are relevant to applications pertaining to health effects, 
              cloud life cycle and precipitation, climate, etc. HARP2 will combine data from multiple along track 
              viewing angles (up to 60), four spectral bands in the visible and near infrared ranges, and three angles 
              of linear polarization to measure the microphysical properties of the atmospheric particles including their size distribution, 
              amount, refractive indices and particle shape.
